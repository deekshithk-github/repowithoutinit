Differentiate Between Centralized & Distributed Version Control System

Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) and Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) are two approaches to managing and tracking changes in software development projects.
In a Centralized Version Control System, a single, central repository stores the entire history and current version of the project. Developers check out files from this central repository to make changes, and changes are committed back to the same location. This system relies heavily on a network connection to the central server, and if the server goes down, it can impede the ability of developers to collaborate and make changes. Additionally, the central repository acts as a single point of failure â€“ if it is compromised or lost, the entire history of the project could be jeopardized.

On the other hand, a Distributed Version Control System operates with a more decentralized approach. Each developer has a complete copy of the entire project, including its history, on their local machine. This means that developers can work independently and make changes locally without relying on a constant network connection to a central server. Collaboration occurs through exchanging changes between repositories, allowing developers to work offline and reducing the risk associated with a central server failure. Popular DVCS tools include Git and Mercurial.

In summary, the main difference lies in the structure and distribution of project data. CVCS relies on a central repository, while DVCS provides each developer with a complete copy of the project. The decentralized nature of DVCS offers advantages like offline work capability and improved resilience against central server failures. Understanding these distinctions helps developers choose the version control system that best aligns with their project needs and collaboration preferences.
